# Release policy for the automatic "merge -> bump -> release" chain
# (.github/workflows/bump-version.yml).
#
# This file is a SOURCEABLE library, not an executable: the workflow does
#   source scripts/release-policy.sh
# so that every decision that answers "does this merge publish a NanoDictate
# version?" is plain, testable shell instead of inline YAML. The test suite is
# scripts/test-release-policy.sh (run by .github/workflows/ci.yml).
#
# Two INDEPENDENT gates decide the outcome, in this order:
#
#   1. policy_pr_has_label — the deliberate opt-out. A merged PR labelled
#      `skip-release` is never bumped and never released, even when its file
#      paths would count as releasable. The label is read from the pull_request
#      event payload (no API call), so this gate costs nothing.
#   2. policy_releasable_paths — the path-based guard. A diff limited to
#      Version.swift, CHANGELOG.md, README.md, SECURITY.md, LICENSE, docs/,
#      .github/, .githooks/, the root meta-dotfiles and packaging files would
#      publish an empty release, so it is classified non-releasable.
#
# The label is an OVERRIDE, not a replacement: the path guard keeps working for
# unlabeled PRs, and unrelated labels (`chore`, `documentation`, `ci`, ...)
# are deliberately NOT overloaded — the release decision stays explicit.
#
# Every no-release outcome is a GREEN no-op (exit 0, nothing written, nothing
# pushed, no release dispatch). Only a broken policy/configuration input — a
# version that cannot be parsed or a version outside the allowed series — is
# allowed to fail the workflow, because a human error that must be
# surfaced rather than silently swallowed.
#
# The RELEASE itself is also here, not in the workflow: policy_next_version
# computes the bumped version and policy_changelog_cut_release cuts the matching
# CHANGELOG section, so the Version.swift constant and the changelog a test
# compares it against can never drift apart.

# Files whose diff alone must never publish a version. Full paths are anchored
# on both ends; a bare `LICENSE` must not swallow `packaging/LICENSE.txt`.
